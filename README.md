# Project
This repository contains my master’s thesis titled "Random Forest with Generalized Least Squares for Spatial Modeling: A Case Study on Lake pH in Sweden."

The thesis explores the application of various Random Forest algorithms to spatially correlated data. It includes experiments on both simulated datasets with controlled spatial autocorrelation and real-world data from lakes across Sweden. The lake data was kindly provided by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), the department that also entrusted me with this project during my thesis work.

**Findings:**  
Conducted a comparative analysis of Random Forest (RF) and Random Forest–Generalized Least Squares (RF–GLS) methods across different scenarios with varying spatial characteristics.
Identified key predictor variables that have the greatest influence on lake pH levels across Sweden.
Presented one of the few practical applications of the RF-GLS approach developed by Arkajyoti Saha, Sumanta Basu, and Abhirup Datta in their paper “Random Forests for Spatially Dependent Data,” using real-world spatial data.

**Key Features:**
- Incorporates spatial autocorrelation with RF–GLS.
- Simulation experiments with varying spatial structures.
- Real-world application to environmental monitoring.
- Organized code and results for reproducibility.

**Key-words:**
- Random Forest
- R
- Spatial statistics
- Environmental data
